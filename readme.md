# Elm Solitaire


Yet another Solitaire game. This time built using Elm. Some code stol-*err*-borrowed from Elm examples.

**Impetus**

To give myself something to try new things and possibly even deploy to app stores. Yes, there are already tons of solitaire apps but there's always room for more. Even if hardly one uses it, it will be good experience.



## Roadmap

1. ~~Display several cards.~~
2. ~~Update the model to support a list of Cards.~~
3. ~~Display cards in model.~~
4. ~~Display cards in columns and rows.~~
5. ~~Add shuffling.~~
6. Arrange cards left to right.
7. Add another suite.
